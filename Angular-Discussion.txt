AGENDA: What is the need to Global Exception Handling?

Below is how we write code if Global Exception Handling is NOT in place.
public async Task<ActionResult<Something>> SomeAction()
{
  try
  {
    ..
    ..
  }
  catch(Exception ex)
  {

  }
}


If we have global exception handling in place, below is how we write/modify the code:
public async Task<ActionResult<Something>> SomeAction()
{
   ..//Write your code
}
